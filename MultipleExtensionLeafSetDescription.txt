This Petri net models the extension of a LeafSet in a pastry net.
A pastry net is a Distributed Hash Table where each node contains certain structures among which a LeafSet. Each object to store has an identifier, which determines on which node it is stored : it is stored on the Node with the closest identifier to the identifier of the object, in the LeafSet we call this Node the Node « Master ».
A LeafSet is linked to an object because it is composed of the Node with the closest identifier to the one of the object : there is the Node « master » but also the node with identifier « on the left » of the node master (with smaller identifiers than the master’s one) and node « on the right » of the node master (with greater identifiers than the master’s one). 
When a node N of the leafSet L crashes, another node of L detects it and notify to the other nodes that this crash is being managed so no other Node manage this crash. It asks the LeafSet Lbis of the Node on the left (if N is at the left of the Node Master) or right Extremity (if N is at the right of the Node Master) of L, a node of Lbis is chosen to replace N. 

We consider that :
-the Petri net has a « Crash Reservoir » which modelizes the event of crashs. The Petri net modelizes the extension of the LeafSet for multiple crashs so the reservoir can have several tokens.
-The crash is handled by one Node, this node is the first one of the LeafSet to detect the crash.
-if the node which crash is the Node Master, then the LeafSet of either the right or left extremity is chosen according to the side of the Node that has detected the crash.
-In the LeafSet of size S, it has S+1 nodes with the node master, S has to be pair so that there are as much node on the left side and the right side.
-When a Node manage a crash, no crash can happen until the Node has finished to mange the crash.

The Crash reservoir can have a number of tokens equals or inferior to the Size S of the LeafSet.
This model has one parameter which is the Size S of the LeafSet (it will have S+1 nodes) which have to be pair so that there are S/2 Nodes on the left 
of The Node master and S/2 Nodes on the right of the Node master.
